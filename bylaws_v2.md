## 1. Purpose

(This section will include the finalized [Mission](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/1) and [Vision](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/2)) 

## 2. Lesson Program Membership

### Overview
Lesson Programs are collections of lessons which comprise one or more Carpentries workshops and the leadership guiding their development and implementation. The following requirements outline the general expectations associated with Lesson Programs; additional detail can be found in the Lesson Program Policy.

### Eligibility for Lesson Program Membership
The Executive Council will be responsible for assessing a prospective Lesson Program for acceptance into The Carpentries, which will require a majority vote. The Executive Directory will be responsible for developing and implementing policies related to Lesson Program onboarding and assessing the ability of community members and staff to meet obligations associated with Lesson Programs.

### Roles and Responsibilities of Lesson Programs
A Lesson Program within The Carpentries should possess the following characteristics:
- Intention and purpose for lessons that align with The Carpentries mission and vision
- Goals and objectives for lessons and/or workshops that are distinct from other Lesson Programs
- Service to a particular audience of learners and instructors
- Evidence of community member commitment to Lesson Program governance (see below), lesson maintenance, and curriculum development

### Governance of Lesson Programs 
Each Lesson Program will have a Lesson Program Committee to serve as community governance organization and act as a point of contact with The Carpentries Executive Council and staff. The Lesson Program Committee will provide the Executive Council with an annual report of Lesson Program operations. 

### Resignation and Termination of Lesson Programs
In the event that Lesson Programs fail to meet the responsibilities described above, the Executive Council may decide to retire the Lesson Program through a majority vote. If the Lesson Program Committee chooses to discontinue the Lesson Program’s association with The Carpentries, they must inform the Executive Council to arrange for separation of responsibilities and resources.

### General Powers
As the highest leadership body of the organization, the Executive Council is responsible for:	
- determining the mission and purposes of the organization
- selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance 
- strategic and organizational planning	
- ensuring strong fiduciary oversight and financial management
- identifying revenue streams and resource development
- approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services 
- enhancing The Carpentries public image

### Responsibilities of Executive Council Members
Each Member of the Executive Council is responsible for:
- knowing the organization’s mission, policies, programs, and needs
- reading and understanding the organization’s financial statements
- serving as active advocates and ambassadors for the organization necessary for The Carpentries to advance its mission
- leveraging connections, networks, and resources to develop collective action to fully achieve the Carpentries’ mission
- helping identify personal connections that can benefit the organization’s fundraising and reputational standing, and can influence public policy
- preparing for, attending, and conscientiously participating in Executive Council meetings	

### Number, Tenure, Requirements, and Qualifications
The Executive Council will be composed of nine (9) Members, each serving a two-year term, without limit on the number of terms. Member terms will begin on January 1st, except when filling between-election vacancies (see below). Five (5) Members of the Executive Council will be elected by the Executive Council (hereafter referred to as "Council-elected"). The other four (4) Members will be elected by the Membership of the organization ("Community-elected").
No employer may have more than two elected or appointed representatives on the Executive Council, and Carpentries staff are not eligible to serve as Executive Council Members. The Executive Council has the final say in determining whether people are working for the same employer. If more than two people who are working for the same employer are elected, they must step down one by one to be replaced by other nominees in order of the number of votes received.

### Regular Meetings and Quorum
The Executive Council must meet at least ten (10) times per year, either in person or online. Quorum for meetings of the Executive Council is five Members, including at least one Council-elected and one Community-elected Member.

### Compensation
Members of the Executive Council shall not receive compensation from the Organization for their service, with the exception of administrative support, travel, and accommodation costs related to their duties on the Executive Council.

### Confidentiality
Members of the Executive Council will sometimes discuss or be made aware of information or activities that may be sensitive to share publicly (e.g. salary information). Executive Council Members are expected to treat such information confidentially and to disclose such information to those outside the Executive Council only when the Executive Council has agreed that such dissemination is appropriate.

### Removal
If a Member of the Executive Council consistently fails to meet the obligations outlined above, they may be removed by a vote of three-quarters (3/4) of the other Members of the Executive Council. A vote to remove a Member must be announced in writing to the entire Executive Council at least ten (10) days in advance of the vote. A vacated Executive Council seat will be filled following the Between-election vacancies procedure outlined in the Nominations and Elections section. 

## 6. Nominations and Elections

### Overview
Four (4) to five (5) of the nine (9) seats on the Executive Council will be re-elected each year, either by the community or by the Executive Council. A general timeline for elections will occur annually as follows:
- Mid-October: Executive Council announces election, soliciting self-nominations for Community-elected Members and recommendations for Council-elected Members
- Late November: Self-nominations close and the Executive Council hosts Community Calls to introduce candidates and discuss the election
- Early December: Election is open for Community-Elected Members
- Mid-December: Executive Council elects Council-Elected Members and announces the Executive Council Members for the following year
- January 1: Responsibility for governance is transferred to the new Executive Council

### Community-elected Members
The Executive Council will seek candidates for Elected Members seats that become vacant. Two (2) of the Appointed Member seats shall be filled at each election. Any voting-eligible Member of The Carpentries may stand for election by announcing their candidacy at least 14 days in advance of the election. If there are not enough nominations to fill all vacant Elected Member seats, the Elected Members will decide amongst them who will remain in office. The Carpentries staff may not stand for election.
Elections will take place once every calendar year and no later than 30 days before the new Executive Council becomes active (Jan. 1). Elections will typically take place in November. Elected Members are to be selected by voting-eligible Members of The Carpentries community and Carpentries staff. Each of these individuals may vote for as many nominees as there are seats to be filled. The nominees who receive the highest number of votes will be elected into the Executive Council.

### Council-elected Members
The Executive Council will identify areas of expertise and experience that are needed by the Council and solicit community recommendations for candidates providing this expertise and experience to be considered for Appointed Member seats that become vacant. Two (2) or three (3) of the Appointed Member seats will be filled each year. The Executive Council must consider at least one more candidate than the number of Appointed Member seats to be filled. All voting-eligible Members of The Carpentries as well as other individuals with relevant backgrounds deemed suitable by the Executive Council are eligible for nomination as Appointed Members. 

Appointed Members are to be selected from among the nominees by the Executive Council by anonymous vote. Each Executive Council Member may vote for as many nominees as there are seats to be filled. Appointed Members will abstain from voting when they themselves are nominated for reappointment. The nominees with the highest number of votes will be appointed. This vote will not take place until after the voting results for Elected Members are known and no later than December 15th. 

### Between-election vacancies
If an Executive Council seat of an Elected Member becomes vacant after the beginning of the year but before the first of October, the Executive Council will strive to fill the seat with one of the non-elected nominees from the previous year’s election, in the order of the number of votes they received. If this effort fails, the Executive Council may appoint a voting-eligible individual member to fill the seat.

If an Executive Council seat of an Appointed Member becomes vacant after the beginning of the year but before the first of October, the Executive Council will strive to fill the seat with another eligible individual member.

In both of these cases, the vacancy will be filled by the new Member for the remainder of the original term only.
